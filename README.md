## About Project

This is a backend-based Weather App made for learning purposes (I have just started development ðŸ¥²).

It takes your location input via the URL and returns a JSON response containing detailed weather information.

You can clone this project and run it on localhost.

You have to enter the following URL in the browser with address of your own choice.
```
localhost:3000/weather/{address}
```

For Example-
```
localhost:3000/weather/Pune
```
